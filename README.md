# GameDesignDocs

Collection of game analysis/design stuff by Richard Wang.


# Drifter Fight Night
  The character designs I've worked on for our platform fighter, as well as the blocking discussion we had on innovating Smash's base shielding mechanic.

# Gladiator
  Upcoming RPG I've also started working on the side, with an emphasis on creating a
  gameplay experience to focus on tension.


# Misc. Guides
  Currently DFO guides I've written for various class discords to help teach newer players as well as provide an analysis for optimization of playstyles for the MMO Dungeon Fighter Online, an 2d action RPG.
