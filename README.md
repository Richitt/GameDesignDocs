# GameDesignDocs

  Collection of game ideas I've worked on and planned to work on.

  Drifter Fight Night is the fighting game my friends and I have been chipping at for the past year or so - in the folder are general character designs I've created,
  as well as thoughts we've had on game mechanics such as blocking.

  Gladiator is a work in progress that I'm currently starting on - the document is a general overview of what I plan to focus on.

  For analysis stuff I've done, I've also put in the Inferno Class guide I wrote for the DFOGlobal Inferno discord, which aims to give a good overview and ideas to focus on for newer players to the class.
